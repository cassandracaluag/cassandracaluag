# hello there!
üêö My name is Cassandra, and I am a rising senior in high school. Welcome to my GitHub!

# about me
ü§ç My interests lie in data science, design, and machine learning - fields that allow me to uncover patterns, solve real-world problems, and build intelligent systems. One day, I hope to become a data scientist at a startup or at a competitive big tech company, where I can work on innovative, high-impact projects and help shape technology from the ground up. 

üåä Currently: I am a Fellow at The Knowledge House (Karim Kharbouch Coding Fellowship), strengthening my skills in product development and UI/UX design by learning industry-standard front-end software. Within this competitive capstone fellowship, I‚Äôm building Harbor: a tech startup and AI-powered health app that offers personalized support and crisis detection, helping to reduce chances of relapse for discharged patients from psychiatric units. 

# socials
Let's be friends - I‚Äôm always open to connecting and gaining new opportunities that help me level up my skills in data science and AI/ML!
