# hello there!
🐚 My name is Cassandra, and I am a senior in high school. Welcome to my GitHub!

# about me
🤍 My interests lie in data science, design, and machine learning - fields that allow me to uncover patterns, solve real-world problems, and build intelligent systems. One day, I hope to become a data scientist at a startup or at a competitive big tech company, where I can work on innovative, high-impact projects and help shape technology from the ground up.
