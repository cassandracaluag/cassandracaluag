# hello there!
🐚 My name is Cassandra, and I am a rising senior in high school. Glad you stopped by!

# about me
🤍 My interests lie in data science and machine learning - fields that allow me to uncover patterns, solve real-world problems, and build intelligent systems. One day, I hope to become a data scientist at a startup or at a competitive big tech company, where I can work on innovative, high-impact projects and help shape technology from the ground up. 

🌊 Currently: I am a Fellow at The Knowledge House (Karim Kharbouch Coding Fellowship), strengthening my skills in product development and UI/UX design by learning industry-standard front-end development software. Within this competitive capstone fellowship, I’m building Harbor - a tech startup and AI-powered wellness app that offers personalized support for mental and physical health.

# tech stack
Python, PyTorch, Flask, Scikit-learn, Numpy, HTML, CSS, Vercel, Matplotlib, Pandas, Figma, JavaScript, C++, Java, Tableau, Jupyter

# socials + my résumé
Let's be friends - I’m always open to connecting and gaining new opportunities that help me level up my skills in data science and AI/ML.
